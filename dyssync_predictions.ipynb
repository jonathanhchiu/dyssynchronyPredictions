    "# Predicting the Dyssynchrony Index\n",

    "## Data Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Input*\n",
    "Our input will be (simulated) vectorcardiograms generated by Chris Villongco using CMRG's Continuity.\n",
    "Our dataset consists of 608 simulated VCGs. These simulations have varying parameters, such as differing stimulus sites and conduction velocities, but are based on the same patient (patient 2, BiV2). We limit our dataset to only 608 examples in the interest of speeding up computational time, as we are more interested in showing proof of concept than obtaining a higher accuracy (of course, we will aim for higher accuracy later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we view the VCG as a sequence, each timestep can be viewed as one element in the sequence. For every time ```t```, we are given three inputs, the  ```(x, y, z)``` coordinates of the vector head.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Output*\n",
    "We will be classifying each VCG based on the corresponding dyssynchrony index from that same simulation. The dyssynchrony index is a scalar value that theoretically ranges from 0 to 1, but we will only be concerned with the range of 0.5 to 1. This range will be further divided into 5 regular intervals, which will serve as our \"classes\". Specifically, these intervals will be ```[0.5, 0.6), [0.6, 0.7), [0.7, 0.8), [0.8, 0.9)```, and ```[0.9, 1.0]```. Simulations with dyssynchrony indices under 0.5 will be considered faulty and will be placed in the first interval, ```[0.5, 0.6)```. Also, note that simulations with dyssynchrony indices of 1.0 will be placed in the last interval, ```[0.9, 1.0]```. These intervals will be labeled as follows (intervals are 0-indexed):\n",
    "* ```0: [0.5, 0.6)```\n",
    "* ```1: [0.6, 0.7)```\n",
    "* ```2: [0.7, 0.8)```\n",
    "* ```3: [0.8, 0.9)```\n",
    "* ```4: [0.9, 1.0]```\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, a VCG sequence with a corresponding dyssynchrony index of 0.78 will be placed in class ```\"2\"``` since it falls in the range of 0.7 and 0.8, the third interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the output of the neural network will be a probability distribution signifying how likely a simulation with the given VCG will have a dyssynchrony index that falls under each of the five intervals."
